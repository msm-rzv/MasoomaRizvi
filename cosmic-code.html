<p class="design">Design & Branding Decisions</p>

<p class="Name">Name Selection</p>
<p>The name <strong>Cosmic-Code Academy</strong> was chosen to capture the imaginative and limitless world of coding through a cosmic lens. The word “Cosmic” evokes a sense of exploration and discovery, while “Code” grounds the brand in its educational focus—teaching Python to high school students. Together, the name is futuristic, inspiring, clearly conveying a sense of learning with limitless possibilities.</p>

<p class="logo-nav-txt">Logo & Navigation Design</p>
<p>The logo features a shooting star paired with the name “Cosmic-Code Academy,” reflecting a space-inspired theme. The shooting star symbolizes ambition, progress, and creativity—key traits we want to associate with coding and learning. The navigation bar is clean and minimal, designed to ensure easy access to course information. Typography uses <strong>Orbitron</strong>, a modern, tech-inspired font that reinforces the coding and futuristic theme. It’s visually bold and easy to read, making it ideal for a high school audience. Hover effects and smooth transitions enhance interactivity, making the site more engaging and fun to explore.</p>

  <img src="images/cosmic/cosmic logo (1).png" alt="Cosmic Code navigation and logo design"/>
</div>

<p class="colourpallete">Color Palette</p>
<p>The Cosmic-Code Academy color palette blends vibrant pinks, purples, white, and black to create a bold yet fun cosmic atmosphere. These colors appeal to high school students and visually connect with the space theme. Purple and pink tones reflect imagination and energy, while black and white provide balance and readability. The overall effect is modern, inviting, and designed to spark curiosity.</p>

  <p class="section-title">DELIVER</p>

  <p>After building the high-fidelity prototype for Cosmic-Code Academy, I conducted informal usability testing with 4 high school students from the target audience:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>2 students with prior interest in Python</li>
    <li>1 beginner with no coding experience</li>
    <li>1 parent evaluating the site for their child</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="section-subtitle">Goals of Testing</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Evaluate clarity of course information and layout</li>
    <li>See how easily users could navigate and find essential details like cost, location, and how to enroll</li>
    <li>Identify any confusion or friction in understanding the course structure or purpose of the site</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="section-subtitle">Key Feedback + Iterations</p>
  <div class="quotes">
    <p>“I love the colors, but I wasn’t sure where to click to get more info.”</p>
    <p>“The course details were there, but kind of easy to miss or too general.”</p>
    <p>“The hover effects were cool—it felt fun, like a game or space app.”</p>
    <p>“I viewed it on my phone and some things didn’t line up properly.”</p>
  </div>

  <p class="section-subtitle">Usability Testing</p>
  <p class="section-subtitle">Based on this feedback, the following updates were made:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reworded and repositioned course info to make it clearer and more visible.</li>
    <li>Refined language around how to enroll, making the email contact method more direct.</li>
    <li>Improved spacing and layout for mobile responsiveness.</li>
  </ul>
