    "Urdu is a rich and poetic language, but it's hard to find well-organized collections of its poetry online. Most platforms don’t let users easily explore poems by author or genre. This project aims to fix that by creating a clear, user-friendly way for people to discover and enjoy Urdu poetry."

    <p>
      I conducted surveys and interviews with a diverse group of users, including Urdu
      literature students, poetry lovers, and casual readers. The research focused on
      understanding their pain points and preferences when exploring Urdu poetry online.
    </p>

    <div class="quotes">
      <p>“I often struggle to find poetry by my favorite poets because the websites are so disorganized.” – Ali, 28</p>
      <p>“I want a platform where I can easily filter poetry by genre or mood.” – Ayesha, 22</p>
      <p>“It’s frustrating to jump between multiple websites to find different poets. A single platform would be a game-changer.” – Farhan, 35</p>
      <p>“I’d love to see more representation of Urdu poetry online, especially for younger audiences.” – Zainab, 19</p>

    <div class="analysis">
      <p>A competitive analysis of existing Urdu poetry platforms revealed several shortcomings:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Poor Navigation: Many platforms lack intuitive navigation, making it difficult for users to find specific poets or genres.</li>
        <li>Lack of Curation: Most platforms do not curate content effectively, leading to a cluttered and overwhelming user experience.</li>
        <li>Outdated Design: Many websites have outdated designs that fail to engage modern users.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>These insights reinforced the need for a platform like Lafs, which prioritizes simplicity, organization, and user engagement.</p>

<p class="design">Design  & Branding Descisions</p>
<p class="Name">Name Selection</p>
<p>The name Lafs was chosen for its poetic meaning—“words” in Urdu—which perfectly aligns with the platform’s purpose: to celebrate and showcase Urdu poetry. It’s short, memorable, and culturally resonant. The logo itself is the Urdu word lafs(لفظ), elegantly presented to reflect the essence of the language and the beauty of the written word.</p>

<p class ="logo-nav-txt">Logo & Navigation Design</p>
<p>The logo and navigation design were crafted with simplicity and poetic elegance in mind. Just beneath the logo, a delicate feather pen icon subtly reinforces the theme of poetry and writing, a visual metaphor for expression, creativity, and tradition. The Urdu script used in the logo mirrors the site’s cultural focus and literary roots. While subtle Urdu letters are placed above each navigation item. These letters reflect the initial phonetic sound of the corresponding section (e.g., 'ر' above "Writers"), adding a layer of cultural immersion and visual interest. The typography balances tradition and simplicity</p>

<div class="navlogo-image">

</div>


<p class="colourpallete">Color Palette</p>
<p> The Lafs color palette features soft blues, soft golds, deep reds, gray, and white. These colors were chosen to create a sense of calm, wonder, and emotional depth mirroring the cosmic, dreamy atmosphere of Urdu poetry. </p>

  <p>After building the high-fidelity prototype, I conducted informal usability testing with 4 users from my target audience:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>2 Urdu poetry enthusiasts</li>
    <li>1 literature student</li>
    <li>1 general user unfamiliar with the site</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="section-subtitle">Goals of Testing</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Test overall clarity and navigation</li>
    <li>Observe how users interacted with the homepage and poet pages</li>
    <li>Identify confusion or hesitation points</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="section-subtitle">Key Feedback + Iterations</p>
  <div class="quotes">
    <p>“I didn’t realize the homepage slider was clickable.”</p>
    <p>“I kept clicking on the poet name thinking it would go to their page.”</p>
    <p>“Genres are great, but I wish they were more visually distinct.”</p>
    <p>“Would be nice if it worked smoothly on mobile.”</p>
  </div>

  <p class="section-subtitle">Usability Testing</p>
  <p class="section-subtitle">Based on these changes the following implementations were made:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Made slider interactions more prominent by adding hover effects and cursor changes, encouraging exploration.</li>
    <li>Updated poet pages so both the image and the name are clickable for better intuitiveness.</li>
    <li>Added more spacing and color contrast to genre buttons for better accessibility.</li>
    <li>Tweaked layout for better mobile responsiveness, ensuring featured poets and navigation stack cleanly.</li>
  </ul>
